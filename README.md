# About me:

### **_My company_**

I currently run multiple companies (Curtis Tech Solutions LLC, Amy AI, and ERPros), and specialize in full stack software engineering. This includes backends, infrastructure (both small businesses and enterprise), automation, AI for loosely formatted data, custom greenfield software development, etc... You name it, I've probably built something with it, or at least know someone who is an expert.

Want to hire us? Send me an email, and we'll set up an introductory call.

I'm also scaling up my operations, and if you're interested in working for CTS, Amy AI, or ERPros, send me an email at [mason@curtistechsolutions.com](mail:mason@curtistechsolutions.com).

### **_Me_**

I wrote my first line of code of C++ code for a simple CLI at 8 years old. Since then, I've worked on MANY different projects of various size, complexity, and popularity. I still have the first ever website I built, but most of the code I wrote in my early teens has been lost over time.
